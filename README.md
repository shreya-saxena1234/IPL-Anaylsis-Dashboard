# IPL-Anaylsis-Dashboard
A Tableau Project which creates a Dashboard

### 1) DATASETS:
I have picked two datasets from Kaggle i.e. :- 
  
####  “ IPL Ball-by-Ball 2008-2020.csv “   & “ IPL Matches 2008-2020.csv"
![image](https://github.com/shreya-saxena1234/IPL-Anaylsis-Dashboard/assets/74912353/9176582a-7622-4a2f-9fd5-8bf6b8591232)    
Since it has no missing , incorrect value no need for performing data cleaning.

#### Hence, I have joined both tables in logical space taking 1000 rows
